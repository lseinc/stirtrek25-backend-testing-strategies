Title: Testing Strategies for Monoliths and Microservices  
Presented by: David Lucas  
Tags: Backend, Programming Principles, CI/CD, Code Quality  
Level: Introductory and overview  

Abstract: 
In any software architecture, be it monolithic or microservice, how you test your code directly influences its quality and reliability. 

In this session, we'll delve into a variety of testing strategies that ensure your code handles both expected and unexpected scenarios with confidence. 

We'll begin by exploring foundational approaches such as unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, 
complemented by practical tips and real code examples that demonstrate how to effectively use mocks, proxies, and simulation stubs.

Moving beyond the basics, we'll tackle advanced testing techniques, including performance, load, and chaos testing, 
to ensure your systems are resilient under pressure. 

Finally, weâ€™ll discuss how to integrate these testing strategies into your CI/CD pipelines, 
empowering you to build and deploy robust applications in an enterprise environment.

By the end of this session, you'll have a well-rounded understanding of essential testing practices and 
actionable insights to apply them effectively in your own projects.
